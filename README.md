# Bounce Challange
 Interrupted project with trampolines as a main mechanic - includes shooting, melee combat, my own implementation of trampoline physisc and other minor mechanics

KNOWN ISSUES:
- TMPro lag spike on first raycast with object
- UI shortcut doesn't refresh on changing from weapon to hands
- unpolished FPS movement
- wrong offset for tenis balls shooting
- object pooling used with tenis balls has wrong queueing
